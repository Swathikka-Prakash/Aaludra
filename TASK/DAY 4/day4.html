      Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written
      in a markup language such as HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS is a
      cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

      CSS is designed to enable the separation of content and presentation, including layout, colors, and fonts. This
      separation can improve content accessibility; provide more flexibility and control in the specification of
      presentation characteristics; enable multiple web pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a
      separate .css file, which reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content; and enable the .css file to
      be cached to improve the page load speed between the pages that share the file and its formatting.

   <h2>CSS FIRST STEPS</h2>
   <p class="css1">CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout web pages — for example, to alter the font, color, size,
      and spacing of your content, split it into multiple columns, or add animations and other decorative features. This
      module provides a gentle beginning to your path towards CSS mastery with the basics of how it works, what the
      syntax looks like, and how you can start using it to add styling to HTML.
